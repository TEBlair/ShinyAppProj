# ShinyAppProj
This is a collection of files for Data613. This project aims to develop an interactive Shiny app that visualizes the Monthly Cost of Goods in the U.S. over the past 10 years, with a focus on food Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation. The application will provide insights into price trends and allow users to explore different food categories through interactive features.

Key Features:
- Time-Based Slider: Enables users to analyze food price trends over time.
- Category Dropdown: Allows selection of food categories such as meats and dairy.
- Predictive Analysis: Forecasts food CPI for 2025, analyzing potential inflation trends.

Datasets will be combined based on observed dates, Total expenditures for "Food at Home" and "Alcoholic Beverages" will be summed and compared with yearly CPI percentage changes, and predictive modeling techniques such as machine learning approaches may be explored for forecasting. This Shiny app will provide an interactive and data-driven way to explore food inflation trends and potential future price shifts.
